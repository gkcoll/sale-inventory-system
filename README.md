# sale-inventory-system

## Introduction

This is a simple project of **Sale & Inventory System**. It was designed for administrator of sellers, so it's not self-service.

## Reference

It was modified from another project: [iiamjune](https://github.com/iiamjune)/**[simple-sales-and-inventory](https://github.com/iiamjune/simple-sales-and-inventory)**. I have used it for my homework directly and praised by the teacher, so I now republish a modified version by me (also the version I committed to teacher).

Then I have used a method of set window icon from my Blog: [【Python】Tkinter 程序设置窗口图标并容灾处理](https://www.gkcoll.xyz/486.html).

## Changed

* Language: English -> 简体中文(Simplified Chinese): I don't think it's a trouble for non-Chinese people. You can choose to use the original project or utilize a machine translator tool to modify it back to English.
* Added support for Administrator account: Only sign in the administrator account, then you can use parts of Add Items & View Items.
* Rewrite function of receipts generating: The core is whitespace quantity compute, but it also is a difficult thing (tip: the width of a Chinese character is double of an English letter.).
